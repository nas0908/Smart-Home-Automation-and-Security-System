# Smart-Home-Automation-and-Security-System
This Project was made towards fulfilling the requirements of Analog Communication Systems subject coursework.

DoorMate is a fully open-source smart home and security setup that runs on a Raspberry Pi 4. It brings together MotionEyeOS, ESPHome, and Home Assistant (all in Docker containers) to help you manage your devices with ease. You get live video feeds from a USB cam and an ESP32-CAM, and it even works with TinyCAM PRO and the Home Assistant app.

Though USB CAM was used for demonstration purposes in this setup for extracting vide feed it can be extended and interfaced with traditional CCTV survelliance setups involving DVR's and NVR's. 

All the details regarding the project can be found out from ACS Final.pdf file.
