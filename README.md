# Smart-Home-Automation-and-Security-System
This Project was made towards the requirements of Analog Communication Systems Subject coursework.

DoorMate is a fully open-source smart home and security setup that runs on a Raspberry Pi 4. It brings together MotionEyeOS, ESPHome, and Home Assistant (all in Docker containers) to help you manage your devices with ease. You get live video feeds from a USB cam and an ESP32-CAM, and it even works with TinyCAM PRO and the Home Assistant app.
